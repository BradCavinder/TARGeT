TARGeT Command Line Release Notes

Description
===========
This is the command line implementation of TARGeT: Tree Analysis of Related Genes and Transposons (http://target.iplantcollaborative.org/). It consists of a Python wrapper script that manages the program options and makes operating system calls to run TARGeT perl scripts, third party programs, and system commands. 

The Nucleic Acids Research article (Han, Burnette, and Wessler, 2009; http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/11/e78.abstract?keytype=ref&ijkey=kxWPUWbTKc8c2wl) describes the web version and underlying perl scripts in detail. Differences between this command line implementation and the web based version are described in the changelog section below. The Python wrapper script was written by Brad Cavinder.


Dependencies
============
TARGeT has only been tested on Linux operating systems. Use with other operating systems (especially Windows OSs) will likely require you to modify the Python script at a minimum. You are on your own with that endeavor. 

The following are required for TARGeT to run and must be in your PATH (i.e. must be callable from any directory without giving an absolute or relative path to the programs). Additionally, only the version(s) listed have been tested. Newer or older versions may or may not work.

  Programs:
   Python - 2.7.2, 2.7.4
   Perl - 5.12.4
   NCBI BLAST2 - 2.2.26 (note: the newer BLAST+ will not work with TARGeT)
   ImageMagick - 6.6.0-4
   MAFFT - 7.037, 7.045
   FastTreeMP - 2.1.7
   TreeBest - 1.9.2

  
Installation
============
TARGeT itself does not require installation as it consists of Python and Perl scripts that do not need to be compiled or installed. The dependencies above do need to be installed per each program's own instructions, adding them to your PATH manually if needed. TARGeT needs to be run from its own directory, containing the Python and Perl scripts and the BLOSUM matrix files.


Usage help
==========
The following command (without the single quotation marks) will return a long help message explaining all the options for running TARGeT:
'python target.py -h' (or just 'target.py -h' if you've added the script to your PATH). Entering only 'python target.py' will return a brief usage statement.


Change Log
==========

2.00 - 10JUN2013 - Major update

   MAFFT has replaced MUSCLE for multiple sequence alignments, and FastTreeMP is now used for tree building with TreeBest still being used to convert the tree file to an EPS image.
   TARGeT can now use multiple processors for the Blast, MAFFT, and FastTree step, leaving the PHI step as the longest running single processor step. The run times for the remaining single processor steps are generally very short.
     - AUG2013 through 08OCT2013 - minor updates 
   Several minor changes were made to improve performance. Version designation being kept at 2.00. Of particular note, queries returning >= 800 hits will be split into ~400 copy groups for multiple sequence alignment.


1.1 - 09JUN2013 - Multiple bug fixes. Removed the need for Python packages pyfasta and setuptools.


1.00 - 15APR2012 - Initial release

   Differeces from the web version:
    - This version does not yet allow the use of other BLAST options that the web interface allows. Similarly, the -diags option for MUSCLE must currently always be used and the -clwstrict option cannot be used. Other options not implemented in the web version are not implemented here either.
    - Improved the readability of tree images containing high numbers of homologs by increasing the height of the images based on homolog count.
    - The web version allows TARGeT to be stopped after any of the BLAST, PHI, or MUSCLE steps in addition to running the full pipeline. This version only runs the complete pipeline though it will check to see if the BLAST database and custom index files have already been created, skipping either or both steps if they have. It will also check to see if the number of homolgs found by PHI is >1. If not, MUSCLE and TreeBest will not be run.
    - The web version allowed the use of only the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix. You may choose from BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62, and BLOSUM80 with this version.
