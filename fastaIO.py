"""This script contains a fasta file iterator, FastaGeneralIterator, that is a modified version of the FastqGeneralIterator in the QualityIO.py script by Peter Cock that is is part of the Biopython distribution and is governed by its license. Please see the Biopython_License file that is included as part of this package.

There is also code, FastaTitleStandardization, to standardize fasta record title lines output from third party software.

FastqGeneralIterator was modified to handle fasta files and FastaTitleStandardization was written by Brad Cavinder"""
